Mashup of multiple judge note styles


[1/10] Goddess Gagged {Protest The Hero}
- normal number

[PASS] Gruntilda's Final Battle {Banjo Kazooie}
- passed file

[3/10] PARANOiA (HADES) -MiDNiGHT MiX- {DontRemember}
- Pad charts aren't exactly what we're looking for on FFR. We're looking for keyboard charts that follow the music via pitch relevancy, layering techniques, etc.

[++/10] Happy Meal {Nero's Day At Disneyland} (iironiic)
- 10/10

[8.5/10] DESTINY {orgt} (bmah)
// Layering works, though some spots feel under-emphasized. Patterns are very good.
9.43-11.08s: Jump PR is backwards.
51.14s: Even though there's no crash here, it's actually louder than the hand at 49.32, but then 52.46s is louder than 51.14s, so this works fine.
54.10s: Different percussion sound and shouldn't be a part of the 8th anchor.
71.91-75.86, 82.46-83.77s: There are some crashes in here and beats that are more emphasized than others, so these shouldn't all be jumps.
96.96-101.25s: Might could use some more hands in here, because this is pretty loud.

[--] Happy Meal {Nero's Day At Disneyland} (TomWinter)
- 0/10

[5/10] Lawn Wake III {The Flashbulb}
10.033/14.833 - could hit up a 16th here
15.733 - note for melody
19.558 - note
26.758 - you missed a snare after the burst
29.158/31.108 - jump
43.108 - again, snares after these couple bursts (117.508)
108.433/110.833 - note
141.508 - did you just copypaste this?
messy+innacurate

[!] Information Transmission {Xi}
- 0/10

[*] Laventale {sakuzyo}
- Conditional Queue

[7.5/10] Arianrhod {LeaF}
3.787 - random weird burst unnecessary
33.035 - take a look at what you're stepping here, it feels really off
35.285 - places like these leave me wondering exactly what you're layering
48.972 - feels better with the 8th notes as not jumps
83.097 - jumpjacks may be a bit excessive here
a bit quirky, interesting layering choices, sometimes i disagree w/ what you're leaving out, but it works well I think. a little of clutter in that polyrhythm section to watch out for, but good job

[*/10] CIA Rave v1000 {DJ Ascent}
- Conditional Queue

[#] [Snowman And Sunshine Girl] -Terror From Beyond- (SuperRemix Gimmix) {expressive} {Digital Explosion}
-  Judge made the file

[--/10] Floating Free {Vibrasphere}
- incorrect BPM, in addition to an improper offset
- chart does not correspond to the music at all and resorts to placing notes completely at random

[<] {~-Zero-~} =PLANET KARMA= ^_^ [superultrabrutal] (yes) endOfSongTitle {obscureArtist} (badStepper)
- There is already a better file in queue

[0/10] KOMMICORE {kommisar}
- Sorry I had to

[10/10] Holy Winter {Cranky}
- 209.769: ugh, right at the end of the file
- absolutely fantastic, oh my god!
- I have a few very subjective qualms with pattern choices, like jumps for repeated notes in a few instances, but it is incredibly fluent and just works.

[$] {~-Zero-~} =PLANET KARMA= ^_^ [superultrabrutal] (yes) endOfSongTitle {obscureArtist} (mediocreStepper)
- File is better than queued file
